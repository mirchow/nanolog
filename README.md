# Nanolog

## Getting Started

* Clone the project on your computer
* Install all the dependencies: `yarn install` or `npm install`
* Run the packager: `yarn run start` or `npm run start`

The project is using [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) and the packager will output a QR code on the terminal so you can open it from the [Expo](https://expo.io/) app on your device.

## Running with simulator

If you have Xcode all setup you can run `yarn run ios`
